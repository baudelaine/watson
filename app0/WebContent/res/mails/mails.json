But because these wolves have been around humans since they were blind, deaf and unable to stand, they will still allow people to be near them, to do veterinary exams, to scratch them behind the ears — if all goes well.","url":null,"attached":"wolf.pdf","picture":null,"face":null,"tip":null,"dId":null,"analysis":{"nlu":null,"ta":null,"d":null,"vr":null,"fr":null,"tr":null}},{"subject":"In California, Fires So Fast Hesitation Proved Lethal","content":"By THOMAS FULLER and RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA 12:00 AM ET.

Mr. Trump repeatedly bashed the agreement during last year’s campaign. Once in the White House, American law required the president to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran was complying. Even Mr. Trump’s adversarial relationship with the truth could not dodge the fact that Iran is in compliance — as determined repeatedly by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the American intelligence community and our closest European allies. Mr. Trump has found it galling to certify — not once, but twice — that a deal he described as “the worst ever” and “an embarrassment” is working.","url":null,"attached":null,"picture":null,"face":null,"tip":"iran.jpg","dId":null,"analysis":{"nlu":null,"ta":null,"d":null,"vr":null,"fr":null,"tr":null}}]
